# OAI Imaging Biomarkers / step toward Digital Twins

## Overview
This project addresses the complexities of Osteoarthritis (OA) through a robust observational approach. Our study focuses on identifying and operationalizing biomarkers predictive of clinical outcomes in OA. We utilize advanced statistical and machine learning techniques, including t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), Elastic Net, and General Linear Models, combined with deep learning and PCA for comprehensive analysis of knee joint morphology.
